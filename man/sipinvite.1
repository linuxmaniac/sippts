.SH NAME
\fBsipinvite\fR \- try to make calls through a PBX system

\fBsipinvite\fR is part of SIPPTS suite: https://github.com/Pepelux/sippts
.SH SYNOPSIS
nuseradd [USERNAME]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsipinvite\fR checks if a PBX server allows us to make calls without authentication. If the SIP server has an incorrect configuration, it will allow us to make calls to external numbers. It can also allow us to transfer the call to a second external number.

For example, if your Asterisk server has a bad context configuration, you can accept INVITE request without authorization. In this case, an attacker can make calls without knowing any user/pass.

\fBsipinvite\fR allows us to:
 - Test remotely if a SIP server requires authentication to make calls.
 - Make calls without auth if the server has a bad configuration.
 - Transfer established calls to a second external number (1).
 - Alter the Callerid if the server allows it.
 - Analyze responses using verbose mode.
 - Allow us to customize the UserAgent.
 - It can use a valid user/pass to make calls with authentication.

(1) If you can send an INVITE through a bad configured server and the call sounds on the target number, it is possible to send a second message (a REFER on this case) to transfer the call to another number:
